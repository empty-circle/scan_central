# scan_central
Scan Central is a bash script designed to cut down on some of the workload when running script scans during cybersecurity research.
It harnessess the power of the NSE (nmap script engine), so most of the credit goes to nmap (which is about the greatest tool period).
All this shell script really does is cut down on your future potential for carpal tunnel. It probably should go without saying,
but the author of this shell script claims no liability for your screw-ups. Your mistakes are your own. Always follow ethics and the law.
